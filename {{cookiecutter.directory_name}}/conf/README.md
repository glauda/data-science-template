# Conf folder

This folder should be used to store configuration files.

This file can be used to provide users with instructions for how to reproduce local configuration with their own credentials. 

## Local configuration

The `local` folder should be used for configuration that is either user-specific (e.g. IDE configuration) or protected (e.g. security keys).

> *Note:* Please do not check in any local configuration to version control.
